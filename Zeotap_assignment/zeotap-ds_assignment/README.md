# eCommerce Data Analysis Project

A comprehensive analysis of eCommerce transaction data using clustering techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive actionable business insights.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes eCommerce transaction data to understand customer behavior, product performance, and sales patterns. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

## Dataset Description

The project uses three main datasets:

1. **Customers.csv**
   - CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
   - CustomerName: Name of the customer
   - Region: Continent where the customer resides
   - SignupDate: Date when the customer signed up

2. **Products.csv**
   - ProductID: Unique identifier for each product
   - ProductName: Name of the product
   - Category: Product category
   - Price: Product price in USD

3. **Transactions.csv**
   - TransactionID: Unique identifier for each transaction
   - CustomerID: ID of the customer who made the transaction
   - ProductID: ID of the product sold
   - TransactionDate: Date of the transaction
   - Quantity: Quantity of the product purchased
   - TotalValue: Total value of the transaction
   - Price: Price of the product sold

## Analysis Performed

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Detailed analysis of customer behavior
   - Product performance analysis
   - Sales trends and patterns
   - Regional analysis

2. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Clustering analysis to identify customer segments
